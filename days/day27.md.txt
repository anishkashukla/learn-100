### How JSON Web Token(JWT) authentication works?
### What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
`
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.
It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.
The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.
JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session, server doesnâ€™t have to completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session information.

### Structure of JWT
A JSON Web Token consists of 3 parts separated by a period.
